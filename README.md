### Note 📍

- I am aware that on some elements the WCAG color contrast ratio has not been met. But in this design, in order to fix it I would have to make some big changes to the background color on two cards, so for now I have left it as it is.

#

### Features 🎉

- Mobile Responsive 📱
- Self-hosted Fonts 🔡

#

### Built with 🔧🔨

- Grid & Flex Layouts 🔲
- Mobile First Approach 📱
- BEM Naming Convention 📚

#

### New Things I Learned 🎓📖

- How to use `grid-template-columns` property.
- Not all images need to have text in the `alt` attribute. If you use images as icons for decoration purposes, no need to describe what that image is using an `alt` attribute. In those cases set the `alt` attribute of the `img` to be null. `alt=""`.
